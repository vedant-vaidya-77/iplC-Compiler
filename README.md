# iplC-Compiler

Constructed a scanner  and a parser for
our language that outputs the syntax tree in a graphical form. To draw
the tree,  used a tool  called graphviz.   There are two  components of
graphviz that  I have  used: The language for  describing the
tree called DOT and a tool called xdot that displays the tree.
